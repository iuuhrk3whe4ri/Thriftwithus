            <h1><b>Our objectives</b></h1>
            <p>Our main aim is to make people aware of the global fashion waste crisis and reduce wastage by encouraging thrifting. Waste pollution can be minimized severely since a huge percentage of waste is produced by the clothes we wear in our daily lives. <br>Offering consumers affordable items they can purchase is another main objective of Thrifted. As most of the items are used once, it still has the value of a brand-new item. Hence, thrifting is way cheaper compared to shopping. <br>Additionally, offering a wide portfolio of high-quality items including vintage pieces is another aim of Thrifted. We not only offer clothes but also shoes, accessories, and home appliances to our customers. This will allow our customers thrifting experience to be more enjoyable and fun.</p>
